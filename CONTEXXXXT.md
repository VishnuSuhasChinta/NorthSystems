When adding a project:
Do not create a separate page unless requested. Add a card to the #projects grid in 

index.html
.
Maintain the .card class structure: Tag -> Title -> Description -> Button.
When styling:
Use CSS Variables defined in :root.
Avoid hardcoded colors; refer to --bg-color, --text-main, etc.
Ensure all new sections have the .animate-on-scroll class for consistency.
Tone of Voice:
Professional but ambitious.
Use words like "Crafting," "Engineered," "Premium," "Utility."
Avoid overly casual slang.
